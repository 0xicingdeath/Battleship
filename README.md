# Battleship game in Python 

This battleship game was created as practice for applications of code design techniques. This is an implementation of one of my childhood games (no user interface on purpose). The rules for this program are outlined here: https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Battleship.PDF 

Specifics on design and module decomposition is outlined in `Specifications.pdf`.
